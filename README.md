# ü¶Å Zoo Management System  

This is our team project for building a **Zoo Management System** in C++.  

This README explains how to set up the repository on your device and how we will work together using Git branches.  

---

## üì• Setup: Get the Repository on Your Device

1. **Clone the repo (first time only):**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devondough926/Zoo-management-system.git
   cd Zoo-management-system
   ```

2. **Check your remotes:**  
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
   You should see `origin` pointing to the GitHub repo.

3. **Configure your name and email (first time only):**  
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
   ```

## üå± Working on the Project

### 1. Create/Checkout Your Branch
Always make sure you are up to date with `main` first:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

Now create your feature branch (replace `<branch-name>` with something clear, like `feature/animal-class`):
```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

If your branch already exists on GitHub, pull it down with:
```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout <branch-name>
```

---

### 2. Make Changes and Save
Do your coding, editing, and testing locally.  

---

### 3. Stage and Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Short description of what you changed"
```

---

### 4. Push to Your Branch
```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

- The first push needs the `-u` flag.  
- After that, just run:  
  ```bash
  git push
  ```

---

### 5. Open a Pull Request
1. Go to the GitHub repo in your browser.  
2. You‚Äôll see a **Compare & Pull Request** button ‚Üí click it.  
3. Make a PR from your branch ‚Üí `main`.  
4. The team reviews and merges when ready.  

---

## üîë Rules for Collaboration
- **Do not push directly to `main`.**  
- Always work on your own branch.  
- Use clear branch names:  
  - `feature/animal-class`  
  - `bugfix/zookeeper-schedule`  
  - `doc/readme-update`  
- Keep commit messages short and clear.  
- Pull from `main` often to stay up to date.

## üõ†Ô∏è Compile Instructions

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 src/*.cpp -o zoo
