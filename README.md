## üå± Working on the Project

### 1. Create/Checkout Your Branch

Always make sure you are up to date with `main` first:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

Now create your feature branch (replace `<branch-name>` with something clear, like `feature/animal-class`):

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

If your branch already exists on GitHub, pull it down with:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout <branch-name>
```

---

### 2. Make Changes and Save

Do your coding, editing, and testing locally.

---

### 3. Stage and Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Short description of what you changed"
```

---

### 4. Push to Your Branch

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

- The first push needs the `-u` flag.
- After that, just run:
  ```bash
  git push
  ```

---

### 5. Open a Pull Request

1. Go to the GitHub repo in your browser.
2. You‚Äôll see a **Compare & Pull Request** button ‚Üí click it.
3. Make a PR from your branch ‚Üí `main`.
4. The team reviews and merges when ready.

## üîë Rules for Collaboration

- **Do not push directly to `main`.**
- Always work on your own branch.
- Use clear branch names:
  - `feature/animal-class`
  - `bugfix/zookeeper-schedule`
  - `doc/readme-update`
- Keep commit messages short and clear.
- Pull from `main` often to stay up to date.
